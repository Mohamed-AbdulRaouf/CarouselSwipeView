  A Carousel Swipe is a design pattern commonly used in mobile apps and websites to showcase a series of images, cards, or content panels that users can scroll or swipe through horizontally or vertically. Itâ€™s a popular way to present content in an interactive, visually engaging format that saves space and gives users more control over what they see.
